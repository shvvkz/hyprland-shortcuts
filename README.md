# Hyprland Shortcuts

Hyprland Shortcuts is a simple and modular CLI tool written in Rust, designed to manage and display keybindings (shortcuts) defined in the `hyprland.conf` configuration file. The goal of this tool is to provide an easy way to visualize, manage, and eventually edit Hyprland shortcuts directly from the terminal.

This tool can also help users create a personalized window to display their shortcuts, or in the future, directly modify them from this window for an even smoother workflow experience.

## üöÄ Features

## üìö Usage

```bash
hyprland-shortcuts [FLAGS]
```

### Available Flags:

* `-v`, `--version` : Display current version.
* `-u`, `--update`  : Check and update to the latest version.
* `-d`, `--display` : Display all comments from the configured shortcuts.
* `-p`, `--path <FILE>` : Provide a custom path to the Hyprland configuration file.
* `-h`, `--help`    : Show help information.

### Example:

```bash
hyprland-shortcuts --display
hyprland-shortcuts --display --path /path/to/your/hyprland.conf
```

#### üìñ Best Practice for Comments

To get the most out of this tool, it is recommended to add comments next to your `bind` and `bindm` lines in the following format:

```ini
bind = SUPER, T, exec some-command # SUPER+T: Open terminal
bindm = SUPER, mouse:273, movewindow # SUPER + Mouse Button 1: Move window
```

The tool will read these comments and display them clearly when using the `--display` flag. This helps you quickly understand the purpose of each shortcut directly from the terminal.
